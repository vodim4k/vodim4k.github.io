<h1 align="center">Talk</h1>
<p>Oh brother, I can't, I can't get through<br>
I've been trying hard to reach you 'cause I don' know what to do<br>
Oh brother, I can't believe it's true<br>
I'm so scared about the future, and I wanna talk to you
Oh, I wanna talk to you<br>
You can take a picture of something you see<br>
In the future where will I be?<br>
<br>You can climb a ladder up to the sun<br>
Or a write a song nobody has sung<br>
Or do something that's never been done<br>
Are you lost or incomplete?<br>
Do you feel like a puzzle, you can't find your missing piece?<br>
Tell me, how do you feel?<br>
Well, I feel like they're talking in a language I don't speak<br>
And they're talking it to me<br>
So you take a picture of something you see<br>
In the future where will I be?<br>
You can climb a ladder up to the sun<br>
Or write a song nobody has sung<br>
Or do something that's never been done<br>
Or do something that's never been done<br>
So you don't know where you're going and you wanna talk<br>
And you feel like you're going where you've been before<br>
You tell anyone who'll listen, but you feel ignored<br>
Nothing's really making any sense at all, let's talk<br>
Let's talk, let's talk, let's tal</p>
